
This module is a modified version to work with 4GB files (thinking in .ciso files > 2GB). 

Normally fseek(fd, x, SEEK_SET) only can access to 2GB files, because it use one s32 as offset, but you can convert s32 to u32 and 
internally works using s64 or u64 to skip the 2GB limit and works with 4GB (FAT32 support files < 4GB. Windows can fail if you try to put a
file equal to 4GB, but .ciso compact the file).

Tested with Red Steel .ciso (about 3.9GB)

Replaced strncpy by strcpy
